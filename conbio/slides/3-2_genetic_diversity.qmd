Genetic diversity
: The genetic variation within species, both among individuals within single populations and among geographically distinct populations
<br>
<br>

Species diversity
: The variety of species that comprise a biological communityâ€”the collection of species that occupy and interact in a particular location
<br>
<br>

Community and ecosystem diversity
: The different biological communities and their associated ecosystems that comprise whole landscapes
<br>

Biological variation is a continuum, and it is notoriously difficult to divide life into discrete categories.

# Genetic Diversity

## Population-Level {.smaller}

Population
: A group of individual organisms of the same species living within a given (or particular) **geographical area** at **the same time**.

. . .

*How do we define the boundary of that geographical area?*

- Usually defined to be of a size in which individuals are likely to **find mates and reproduce**
- Species that are geographically widespread are often subdivided into **distinct breeding groups** that live in different geographical areas. 
- These geographically separated groups are sometimes referred to as **different populations** of the same species or as **subpopulations** of the species.

For the F2 Generation:

- What is the **genotype frequency** of *YyRr*?
- What is the **allele frequency** of *r*?
- If we only consider the *Y* gene, what is the frequency of **heterozygotes?**
- If we only consider the *R* gene, what is the frequency of **homozygotes?**

## Markers in Population Genetics {.smaller}

Polymorphic Locus
: A gene for which more than one allele exists in the population
<br>
<br>

Polymorphism
: the fraction of gene loci in which alternative alleles of a gene occur

:::{.notes}

This example shows how to calculate polymorphism and heterozygosity of a hypothetical population of frogs (left). 

- Assume that five frogs are sampled randomly such that they are representative of the larger population of frogs. 
- Each of the five frogs is then genotyped to determine which alleles it has at each of two loci: 
  - at locus A it has either allele A1 or A2, while at locus B it has either allele B1, B2, or B3. 
- After genotyping each frog, one can calculate the proportion of loci at which each individual is heterozygous, hi, which is then used to calculate the average heterozygosity, H, of frogs that were sampled. 
- One can also calculate the degree of polymorphism, P, of the sampled frogs, as well as the frequency of each allele in the sampled population.
