Biological variation is a continuum, and it is notoriously difficult to divide life into discrete categories.

- Genetic diversity refers to the genetic variation within species, both among individuals within single populations and among geographically distinct populations.
- Species diversity refers to the variety of species that comprise a biological communityâ€”the collection of species that occupy and interact in a particular location.
- Community and ecosystem diversity refers to the different biological communities and their associated ecosystems that comprise whole landscapes.

# Sources of Genetic Variation

## Population-Level

::: {.notes}

- A population is a group of individual organisms of the same species living within a given (or particular) geographical area at the same time. 
- The geographical area is usually defined to be of a size in which individuals are likely to find mates and reproduce. 
- Species that are geographically widespread are often subdivided into distinct breeding groups that live in different geographical areas. 
- These geographically separated groups are sometimes referred to as different populations of the same species or as subpopulations of the species.
