## London's Great Smog (1952)

1. Airborn nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and soot **from coal burning**
2. Cold weather + windless conditions

:::

:::

. . .

**Result:** a blanket of smog covered London for five days

::: {.notes}

- Thousands died and 100,000 fell ill
- Cold weather combined with windless conditions allowed airborne nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and soot from coal burning to form a thick layer of smog over the city.
- Recent research has shown that 12,000 premature deaths can be partially attributed to this smog.

## Love Canal (1953) {.smaller}

Hooker Chemical Company began dumping industrial waste into the Love Canal near Niagara Falls, NY in the 1940s.

:::{.columns}

:::{.column}

- Love Canal residents reported strange odors and blue goo bubbling into their basements.
- High rates of asthma, miscarriages, mental disabilities, and other health problems brought Love Canal into the spotlight in 1978

**56% of children born there between 1974 and 1978 had birth defects.**

::: {.notes}

- After the site was later sold and developed, Love Canal residents reported strange odors and blue goo bubbling into their basements.
- High rates of asthma, miscarriages, mental disabilities, and other health problems brought Love Canal into the spotlight in 1978, and subsequent surveys found that 56% of children born there between 1974 and 1978 had birth defects.
- New York State Health Commissioner David Axelrod called the incident a “national symbol of a failure to exercise a sense of concern for future generations.” The U.S. government soon after passed the Superfund law.

## Silent Spring (1962) {.smaller}

After WWII, DDT was promoted as a wonder chemical

:::{.column}

- Rachel Carson published *Silent Spring* in 1962
  - highlighted the dangers & consequences of DDT
  - testified before U.S. Congress

. . .

**The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was founded and subsequently banned the use of DDT**

::: {.notes}
- Carson’s book, and testimony before the U.S. Congress, helped trigger the establishment of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which subsequently banned the use of DDT.

## Cuyahoga River (1969) {.smaller}

. . .

The river repeatedly caught fire over several years.

## Earth Day (1970)

The first official Earth Day (April 22, 1970) marks a turning point in Environmental awareness and activism, particularly in the US, Canada, and Europe.

![](figures/earth_day.png){.img-border}

. . .

This also correlates with the emergence of Conservation Biology as a scientific discipline.

::: {.notes}

- Ecologist Michael Soulé organized the First International Conference on Research in Conservation Biology in 1978

## An Interdisciplinary Field

![](figures/Ch02/c02fig008.jpg){height=500px}

:::

::: {.notes}
- Soulé proposed a new interdisciplinary approach that could help save plants and animals from the threat of human-caused extinctions.
- Though founded in the disciplines of biological sciences and natural resource management, conservation has expanded to include the social sciences, humanities, physical sciences, and engineering.

## Views of Conservation {.smaller}

::: {.img-frame}

![](figures/Ch02/c02fig009a.png)

:::

::: {.notes}

- Soulé argued that conservation biology was more than just environmentalism, in which decision-making was based largely on philosophical, religious, and ethical arguments

![](figures/Ch02/c02fig009b.png)

:::

::: {.notes}

- Soulé argued that conservation biology was a form of normative science
- Soulé went on to outline what he called the functional and normative postulates that, in his view, represent the core principles and values of the field

![](figures/Ch02/c02fig009c.png)

:::

::: {.notes}


- People are motivated to conserve biodiversity for a large variety of reasons
  - some of which are based on normative viewpoints and others of which are based on positive viewpoints. 
- While one type of motivation is sometimes emphasized over the other, rarely do we treat those motivations as if they are mutually exclusive in any real act of decision-making. 
- Complementary, because different people respond to different value systems.

## A Crisis Discipline

Practitioners must take action even in the absence of complete information, because waiting to collect the necessary data may result in irreversible loss.

::: {.notes}

- Soulé argued that conservation biology differs from most other biological sciences in that it is a crisis discipline
- Conservation biologists are often asked for advice and input by government and private agencies.  
- Therefore, the “expert” is expected to provide quick, unambiguous answers even in the absence of complete knowledge. 
- This is a major challenge for conservation biologists, who must walk a fine line between scientific credibility and taking action and providing advice based on general and perhaps incomplete knowledge
