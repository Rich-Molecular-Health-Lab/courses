## Measures of Species Diversity {.center}

::: aside
Diversity metrics that consider species evenness in addition to richness can be used to represent the higher diversity of species.

## Species Accumulation Curves {.smaller}

::: columns
:::{.column style="margin-top:100px"}
- Used to show when sampling is [complete]{.green} and [all species]{.green} have been identified
- Quantifies the [number of species]{.green} found *(y)* per [sampling effort]{.green} *(x)*.

## Extrapolation Curves {.smaller}

::: columns
:::{.column style="margin-top:100px"}
[Fit to data]{.green} from an Accumulation curve to estimate [how many species]{.green} there might be.

::: aside
Advanced techniques may estimate the asymptotic richness of a collection that has been undersampled.

## Comparing Sampling Efforts {.smaller}

::: columns
:::{.column}

:::{.callout-tip title="At which site would you expect to document more species?"}
::: {.fragment .fade-in fragment-index=1}
- *Probably at Site 1, where sampling effort is greater.*
:::
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in fragment-index=2}
:::{.callout-tip title="How can we test whether site differences are meaningful?"}
::: {.fragment .fade-in fragment-index=3}
We can [rarefy]{.green} our counts.
<br><br>
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-in fragment-index=4}
- [Rarefaction]{.green} randomly selects a subset of observations from each site to equalize the sampling effort.
- The resulting [rarefaction curve]{.green} can be used to compare species richness at the same level of sampling effort.

The relative priority of the individual mountains should then be judged based on the relative rarity of the assemblages.

::: notes
Biodiversity indexes for three regions, each consisting of three separate mountains. Each letter represents a population of a species; some species are found on only one mountain, while other species are found on two or three mountains. Alpha, gamma, and beta diversity values are shown for each region. If funds were available to protect only one mountain range, region 2 should be selected because it has the greatest gamma (total) diversity. However, if only one mountain could be protected, a mountain in region 1 should be selected because these mountains have the highest alpha (local) diversity, that is, the greatest average number of species per mountain. Each mountain in region 3 has a more distinct assemblage of species than the mountains in the other two regions, as shown by the higher beta diversity. If region 3 were selected for protection, the relative priority of the individual mountains should then be judged based on the relative rarity of the assemblages.
