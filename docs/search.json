Each letter represents a population of a species; some species are found on only one mountain, while other species are found on two or three mountains. Alpha, gamma, and beta diversity values are shown for each region. If funds were available to protect only one mountain range, region 2 should be selected because it has the greatest gamma (total) diversity. However, if only one mountain could be protected, a mountain in region 1 should be selected because these mountains have the highest alpha (local) diversity, that is, the greatest average number of species per mountain. Each mountain in region 3 has a more distinct assemblage of species than the mountains in the other two regions, as shown by the higher beta diversity. If region 3 were selected for protection, the relative priority of the individual mountains should then be judged based on the relative rarity of the assemblages."
