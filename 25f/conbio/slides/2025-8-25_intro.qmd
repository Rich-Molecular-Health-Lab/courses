## Attendance {.smaller}

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="40%"}
- Not a hybrid or asynchronous course
  - *I only present content during class time.*
  - *I only offer one opportunity for participation*

:::{.column width="60%"}
![](../../../graphics/gifs/attendance_rory.gif)
:::
:::
- I build in flexibility to allow everyone to miss occasionally without penalty
  - I do not micromanage attendance
  - Excuses are not necessary
  - Collaborate with classmates to get notes or ask what you missed



## Instructor cringe


:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="40%"}

- *"What did I miss?"*
- *"Will this be on the test?"*
- *"Do we need to take notes on this?"*
- *"When can you set aside time to help me catch up on all the classes I missed this semester?"*
