# Causes of Extreme Heat

## What influences Heat?

While temperature is largely caused by the sun and weather systems there are other factors that influence it.

## Weather

### Where the wind comes from

- Winds coming off the water will carry cooler maritime air over the warm land.
- Winds coming over the land will generally be warmer
  - particularly if they're coming from lower latitudes or the desert

### Temperatures in the upper atmosphere

- Temperatures high enough above the surface aren't influenced by daytime changes caused by the sun
  - or low-level winds such as coastal sea breezes
- Air mixing throughout the day brings this upper-level air down.
  - becomes warmer as it approaches the surface
  - Air is more compressed at lower levels, because air pressure increases as height decreases.
  - This compression increases its temperature at a rate of around 10°C/k – a process known as **adiabatic warming**.

## Weather

### Sunlight and Shade

- Air temperature is officially measured in the shade at 2 m off the ground
  - *away from influences that can cause fluctuations in the reading*
  
### Humidity and Wind Chill

- They're not taken into account where temperature is measured.

## Shape of the Land

### Mountains and high places

- Temperatures decrease as height increases, at an average rate of 6.5°C for every 1000m.
  - The atmosphere becomes thinner with height, due to gravity.

### Valleys

- Valleys that dip below sea level record some of the highest temperatures on the planet.
  - Valleys are excellent at collecting and holding hot air that sinks.
- Air moving down the valley from above can also add to the heat.
  - This is called **katabatic wind**
    - *adiabatic warming* is at play.
- Sloping surfaces around the valley also mean a greater surface area is available to capture solar heat (*compared to a flat surface*).
- At night, valleys can become colder than surrounding areas.
  - Colder air is more dense, so it will sink towards the bottom of a valley.

## Bodies of Water

### Water Bodies moderate Surrounding Land Temperatures

- Retain large amounts of heat.
- Take a long time to heat up and cool down compared to the land.

### Ocean Currents

- Warmer currents translate to warmer land temperatures and vice versa.
  - The best global example of this is the Atlantic Gulf Stream.
  - Southern Europe remains much warmer than the northeast of the USA in the winter despite being at similar latitudes.

## Urban Heat Island Effect

Heat islands are urbanized areas that experience higher temperatures than outlying areas.
: Buildings, roads, and other infrastructure absorb and re-emit the sun’s heat more than natural landscapes such as forests and water bodies.


## Urban Heat Island Effect

- Temperatures are different at the surface of the earth and in the atmospheric air, higher above the city.
- For this reason, there are two types of heat islands:
  1.  **Surface Heat Islands**
  2.  **Atmospheric Heat Islands**
- Surface temperatures vary more than atmospheric air temperatures during the day, but they are generally similar at night.


[The dips and spikes in surface temperatures over the pond area show how water maintains a nearly constant temperature day and night because it does not absorb the sun’s energy the same way as buildings and paved surfaces.]

::: {.notes}

- Parks, open land, and bodies of water can create cooler areas within a city.
- Temperatures are typically lower at suburban-rural borders than in downtown areas. 

:::

## Surface Heat Islands

- These heat islands form because urban surfaces such as roadways and rooftops absorb and emit heat more effectively than most natural surfaces.

. . . 

>On a warm day with a temperature of 91°F, conventional roofing materials may reach as high as 60°F warmer than air temperatures.

- Surface heat islands tend to be most intense during the day when the sun is shining.

## Atmospheric Heat Islands

- These heat islands form as a result of warmer air in urban areas compared to cooler air in outlying areas.

. . .

>Atmospheric heat islands vary much less in intensity than surface heat islands.

# Consequences of Extreme Heat

## Impacts of Urban Heat Islands

### Increased Energy Consumption

### Elevated Emissions of Air Pollutants and Greenhouse Gases

### Compromised Human Health and Comfort

### Impaired Water Quality

## Vulnerable Populations

::: {.columns}

::: {.column}

### Older Adults

- Older adults are more likely to be in poor health, less mobile and isolated, more sensitive to high heat, and to live on reduced incomes.

:::

::: {.column}

### Young Children

- More rapid breathing rates relative to body size
- More time spent outdoors
- Developing respiratory systems 

. . .

All raise childrens' chances of aggravated asthma and other lung diseases caused by ozone air pollution and smog, which usually increases during heat waves.

## Vulnerable Populations

::: {.columns}

::: {.column}

### Low Income Communities

- Greater risk of heat-related illnesses due to poor housing conditions
  - E.g., lack of air conditioning, small living spaces
- Inadequate resources to find alternative shelter during a heat wave.

:::

::: {.column}

### Outdoor Workers

- They have higher exposures to ozone air pollution and heat stress
  - Especially if work tasks involve heavy exertion.

## Vulnerable Populations

::: {.columns}

::: {.column}

### People with Chronic Illnesses

- Chronic conditions like diabetes and cardiovascular illness place people at higher risk of death. 
- Certain medications impair thermoregulation.

:::

::: {.column}

### People with Disabilities

- Physical impairments and cognitive deficits increase risk during heat waves. 
- Mobility constraints increase negative impacts and risk.

# Mitigation & Resilience

## Reduce the Risks

The EPA suggests four main strategies for long-term risk reduction.
