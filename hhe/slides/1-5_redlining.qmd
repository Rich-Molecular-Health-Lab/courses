## Redlining

“Redlining” refers to a now-illegal practice from the 1930s when the federal government labeled non-White neighborhoods as undesirable for real estate investment. 
: Public and private lenders often withheld loans and other services from people in those areas, depriving residents of opportunities to grow their wealth.


## The Home Owners’ Loan Corporation

- A government agency established in 1933 by FDR as part of the New Deal to help homeowners who were at risk of losing their homes to foreclosure.
- The HOLC also created a housing plan that served as the basis for the National Housing Act of 1934.
- Most of the neighborhoods (74%) that the HOLC graded as high-risk or “Hazardous” are low-to-moderate income (LMI) today.
- Most of the HOLC-graded “Hazardous” areas (nearly 64%) are minority neighborhoods now.
